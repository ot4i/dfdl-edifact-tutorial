# dfdl-edifact-tutorial
IBM Integration Bus tutorial: modeling UN/EDIFACT using DFDL schemas

The src folder contains the IIB eclipse projects that comprise this tutorial. There are two shared libraries, EDIFACT-Common and EDIFACT-D03B. There are no applications as this tutorial does not deploy to an integration node.

The doc folder contains the json file from which the tutorial html pages are generated.

The gh_pages contain the generated 'steps' and 'details' html pages, plus a copy of repo_metadata.json modified to include an entry for this tutorial (for testing purposes), plus other javasscript etc files needed for the html pages.
